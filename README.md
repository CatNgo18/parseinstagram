## Notes

**Part 1:**
The video tutorial went by really fast and it was hard to catch up at points but I think I'm having an easier time understanding the concepts.

**Part 2:**
I felt like I could follow the video tutorial a lot better this time, but this was the first time that I had to deal with bugs from Android Studio and the emulator. It took a really long time to fix since I wasn't sure what to do and was trying every solution I could find. It was honestly pretty frustrating but I'm glad that I have more experience with troubleshooting those types of bugs.
